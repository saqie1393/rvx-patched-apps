# Patched Apps

[![CI](https://github.com/andrewliang25/patched-apps/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?event=schedule)](https://github.com/andrewliang25/patched-apps/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A personal Morphe patches builder that produces non-root APKs and Magisk/KernelSU modules, updated automatically via CI. Built on top of [**j-hc/revanced-magisk-module**](https://github.com/j-hc/revanced-magisk-module) — the build engine, module template, and tooling are j-hc's work.

**Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/andrewliang25/patched-apps/releases).**

Every release APK/module is published with [GitHub build provenance attestations](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds) — confirm a file was built by this repo's CI with:

```
gh attestation verify <file> --repo andrewliang25/patched-apps
```

Each app is a single config entry that emits two output types:

* **non-root APK** — install directly, no root. Most apps' APKs are package-renamed (a `app.<patch>.<pkg>` "clone", or the MicroG-RE variant for Google apps) so they install *alongside* the official app rather than replacing it.
* **module** — Magisk/KernelSU module that mounts the patched APK over the stock app. Keeps the original package, so it needs root and the stock app installed. (Instagram and Twitter/X ship as APK-only — their modules were dropped.)

> **Experimental:** Instagram and Facebook are integrity-protected (pairip) apps; their patched builds may not run on all setups.

## Installing

* **Non-root YouTube, YT Music, and Google Photos APKs** need [MicroG-RE](https://github.com/MorpheApp/MicroG-RE/releases) installed.
* **All KernelSU/Magisk modules:** add the target app to the Zygisk **DenyList** (or the mount won't apply), and use [**zygisk-detach**](https://github.com/j-hc/zygisk-detach) to detach them from the Play Store to prevent being updated.

### Meta-app clones: duplicate-permission conflict

Meta clone APKs may fail to install alongside the official app with `INSTALL_FAILED_DUPLICATE_PERMISSION`.

Known affected (each pair shares the same custom permissions, so only **one** of the two can be installed at a time):

* **Facebook** + **Messenger** — stock and patched both declare the same `com.facebook.*` permissions; you can keep only one across the Facebook/Messenger family.
* **Threads** — stock and patched Threads conflict on Threads' own shared permissions; you can keep only one.

Workarounds: uninstall the conflicting official Meta app first, or use the root **module** (original package, no permission rename needed) instead of the clone.

### Instagram Piko module: Piko settings won't open

The Instagram **module** has been dropped. On the mounted original-package build the Piko settings screen could not be opened — see [crimera/piko#882](https://github.com/crimera/piko/issues/882) — so Instagram now ships **only** the clone APK (`app.piko.instagram.android`), where the settings open normally.

### Twitter/X Piko module: dropped

The Twitter/X **module** has been dropped — the mounted, original-package build had runtime issues, while the patched non-root APK works. Twitter/X now ships **only** the non-root APK. That APK is *not* cloned, so it keeps the package `com.twitter.android` and can't coexist with the Play Store build — uninstall the official X app first.

## Building locally

### On Termux
```console
bash <(curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewliang25/patched-apps/main/build-termux.sh)
```

### On Linux
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/andrewliang25/patched-apps --depth 1
$ cd patched-apps
$ ./build.sh
```

## Customizing the build

* Edit [`config.toml`](./config.toml) to include/exclude patches or add/remove apps. You can generate a config with [rvmm-config-gen](https://j-hc.github.io/rvmm-config-gen/).
* See [`CONFIG.md`](./CONFIG.md) for all available options.
* Run the [Build workflow](../../actions/workflows/build.yml) (or wait for the daily CI run) and grab the outputs from [releases](../../releases).

Twitter and Instagram use [Piko](https://github.com/crimera/piko) (Twitter additionally layers [x-shim](https://gitlab.com/inotia00/x-shim) on top, applied as a second patch bundle, for X 12.x support); Facebook, Messenger, Threads, and Google Photos use [De-Vanced](https://github.com/RookieEnough/De-Vanced); Telegram uses [Paresh-Patches](https://gitlab.com/Paresh-Maheshwari/paresh-patches) — all driven by the [Morphe CLI](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-cli). Downloaded stock APKs are signature-verified against each app's official signing certificate (`sig.txt`).

### Config notes

The config is kept comment-free; here's what the non-obvious settings mean:

* **`clone = true`** (Reddit, Facebook, Messenger, Threads, Photos) — with `build-mode = "both"`, the apk-mode output is package-renamed to `app.<patch>.<pkg>` (e.g. `app.devanced.facebook.katana`) so the **non-root APK** installs alongside the official app, while the **module** keeps the original package to mount over the stock app. (The clone APK *is* that renamed non-root APK — not a separate artifact.) Same single-entry pattern YouTube/YT Music get from MicroG-RE. **Instagram** is also `clone = true` but `build-mode = "apk"` — APK-only (renamed to `app.piko.instagram.android`); its mounted module was dropped over the [Piko-settings bug](#instagram-piko-module-piko-settings-wont-open). **Twitter** is `build-mode = "apk"` and *not* cloned; its mounted module was [dropped](#twitterx-piko-module-dropped) too.
* **Twitter `extra-patches-source` (Piko + x-shim)** — newer X builds need [inotia00/x-shim](https://gitlab.com/inotia00/x-shim) applied *alongside* Piko. `extra-patches-source` adds it as a second patch bundle in one patch run, so Twitter tracks `version = "auto"` (~12.2.0) instead of pinning, and the old `'Block redirecting to X Lite'` exclusion is gone. A new x-shim release self-triggers a daily rebuild. See [`CONFIG.md`](./CONFIG.md).
* **Self-hosted stock APKs (archive.org)** — Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, and Instagram stock APKs are mirrored on a self-hosted archive.org item because apkmirror 403s (and uptodown doesn't reliably serve) their builds. They track `auto`: Facebook resolves to the only De-Vanced–supported build (currently `490.0.0.63.82`) and Messenger to `563.0.0.47.86`, served from the archive while available, falling back to each app's secondary source (uptodown for Facebook, apkmirror for Messenger) if a newer resolved version isn't mirrored yet.
* **`enable-module-update`** — set `false` to stop the modules from receiving in-app updates.

### CI notifications

CI posts to two Telegram destinations (both via the `TG_TOKEN` bot secret): successful release announcements go to the public channel set by the `TG_CHAT` repo variable, while a **daily status heartbeat** (built / skipped / failed) and **build-failure alerts** go to a private admin chat set by the **`TG_CHAT_ADMIN`** repo variable. The send logic is shared in [`.github/scripts/tg-notify.sh`](./.github/scripts/tg-notify.sh); if a destination variable is unset, that notification is silently skipped. To get the numeric `TG_CHAT_ADMIN` id for a private channel, add the bot as an admin, post a message, and read `chat.id` from `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TG_TOKEN>/getUpdates`.
