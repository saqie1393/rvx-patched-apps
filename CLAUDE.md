# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A fork of [j-hc/revanced-magisk-module](https://github.com/j-hc/revanced-magisk-module): a Bash-based builder that downloads stock Android APKs, applies ReVanced (or compatible: Morphe, Piko) patches via the ReVanced CLI, and packages the result either as non-root APKs or as Magisk/KernelSU modules. It is driven entirely by `config.toml` and runs daily in GitHub Actions.

There is no compiled application source here — the "code" is shell scripts plus prebuilt helper binaries. The patches and CLI themselves are fetched at build time from upstream GitHub releases.

## Commands

```bash
./build.sh                      # build everything enabled in config.toml
./build.sh config.toml          # explicit config (also accepts a .json config)
./build.sh clean                # remove temp/, build/, build.md, patches-built.json
./build.sh config.toml --config-update   # print a trimmed config of apps with newer patches available (used by CI to decide whether to build)
```

Requirements: `jq`, OpenJDK 17+, `zip` (build.sh checks these and aborts if missing). On Termux, `build-termux.sh` bootstraps the environment and handles output to `/sdcard/Download`.

There is **no test suite and no linter**. To validate changes, run a build with a single app enabled (set `enabled = false` on the rest in `config.toml`, or `enabled = true` on just one). `NORB=true` skips rebuilding APKs that already exist in `temp/`/`build/` — useful when iterating on module-packaging logic without re-patching.

## Architecture

Three files do all the work:

- **`build.sh`** — entry point. Parses `config.toml`, resolves per-app settings (with main-table defaults), fetches CLI + patches prebuilts once per source, then spawns `build_rv` in the background for each app/arch, throttled to `parallel-jobs`. `arch = "both"` fans out into two builds (arm64-v8a + arm-v7a).
- **`utils.sh`** — the engine. Everything else lives here: TOML parsing, GitHub/HTTP downloads, the four download backends, version resolution, patching, and module packaging. `build.sh` is mostly config plumbing around `utils.sh`'s `build_rv`.
- **`module/`** — the Magisk/KernelSU module template. Copied per-build into `temp/`, filled with `module.prop` + `config`, and zipped. `customize.sh` is the on-device installer (runs at flash time, not build time): it installs the correct stock version, mounts the patched `base.apk` over the real one via bind mount, and handles arch/version checks.

### The build pipeline (`build_rv` in utils.sh)

1. **Resolve package name** by probing download sources for the app.
2. **Resolve version** per `version` mode: `auto` picks the highest version supported by all included patches (parsed from CLI `list-versions` output); `latest`/`beta` take the newest from the download source; a literal version is used as-is.
3. **Download stock APK** by trying each configured `*-dlurl` source in `DL_SRCS` order (`direct`, `archive`, `apkmirror`, `uptodown`). Bundles (`.apkm`/`.xapk`) are merged into a single APK via APKEditor and re-signed.
4. **Verify signature** against `sig.txt` (skips apps not listed there).
5. **Patch** via `patch_apk` → ReVanced CLI, signing with `ks.keystore`.
6. **Package** for each build mode:
   - `apk` (non-root): the microg/gmscore patch is *included*; output goes straight to `build/`.
   - `module` (root): the microg patch is *excluded* (the module mounts over the real app, so it relies on the stock signature); the patched APK plus optional stock APK are zipped with the module template.

### Download backends

Each source implements the same informal interface — `get_<src>_resp`, `get_<src>_pkg_name`, `get_<src>_vers`, and `dl_<src>` — so `build_rv` can iterate over `DL_SRCS` generically. apkmirror/uptodown scrape HTML using the `htmlq` binary; archive/direct parse URLs. Adding a source means adding these four functions and an entry to `DL_SRCS`.

### Prebuilt binaries (`bin/`)

`set_prebuilts` selects arch-specific binaries by `uname -m`: `tq` (TOML→JSON, the `$TOML` parser), `htmlq` (HTML scraping), `aapt2` (Termux/Android only). `paccer.jar` + `dexlib2.jar` strip ReVanced integrations checks from the patches bundle when `remove-rv-integrations-checks = true`. `apksigner.jar` signs APKs. Module installer ships a per-arch `ksu_profile` binary.

## Configuration (`config.toml`)

The main (top-level) table sets defaults; each `[App]` table overrides them. Keys are documented in `CONFIG.md`. Two gotchas:

- Patch names in `excluded-patches`/`included-patches` must be quoted, and a single quote *inside* a patch name is escaped by doubling it (`'Hide ''Get Music Premium'''`).
- `toml_get` returning non-zero means "key absent" — the `|| DEFAULT` idiom throughout `build.sh` depends on this, so it's load-bearing, not sloppy error handling.

## CI (`.github/workflows/`)

`ci.yml` runs daily on cron: it checks out `patches-state.json` from the `update` branch and runs `--config-update` to see if any enabled app has newer patches; only then does it call `build.yml`. `build.yml` builds, uploads APKs/modules to a GitHub Release tagged with an incrementing version code, regenerates `*-update.json` files and `patches-state.json` on the `update` branch (the JSONs power in-app Magisk module updates), and optionally posts to Telegram. The `update` branch is data, not code — it holds `build.md` (the release-notes changelog), `patches-state.json` (the per-app build-decision state), and the per-module update JSONs.

**`patches-state.json` — the build-decision state (fork-specific).** `config_update` decides whether an app needs a rebuild by comparing the *current* patch-bundle asset for each of its sources (primary + `extra-patches-source`) against what that app was *last successfully built with*, recorded per app in `patches-state.json` (`{ "<table>": { "<patches-source>": "<asset-name>" } }`). This replaced an earlier design that grepped `build.md`. The problem with `build.md`: it's regenerated from scratch each run holding **only that run's built subset**, so once a different subset built and overwrote it, apps that had fallen out of `build.md` looked un-recorded and got rebuilt unconditionally every day (spurious `versionCode` churn with identical versions). `patches-state.json` is instead **merged, not overwritten** — `build.yml` folds this run's `patches-built.json` into the existing state with `jq -s '.[0] + .[1]'`, so earlier runs' apps keep their record. Two deliberate semantics: (1) state is written **only on a successful build** (`build_rv` records via `log_built_patches` after an artifact is produced; a failed build stays un-recorded → retried next run — matching how `*-update.json` is only written for shipped modules); (2) an app not in the state (newly added, or never-successfully-built) always rebuilds. Because state is keyed per app and covers apk-only apps too (recorded regardless of build mode), the apk-only + `extra-patches-source` gaps that made a naive "compare against `*-update.json`" approach lossy don't apply. A source the GitHub/GitLab API can't resolve is treated as "no change" so a transient API error never triggers a full rebuild.

**Telegram notifications.** All Telegram posts go through `.github/scripts/tg-notify.sh` (curl wrapper; no-ops if `TG_TOKEN`/`TG_CHAT` env is empty). Two destinations, one bot (`TG_TOKEN` secret): the **public** release announcement in `build.yml`'s "Report to Telegram" step posts to `TG_CHAT` (var); the **admin** notifications post to `TG_CHAT_ADMIN` (var). Admin gets a daily heartbeat from `ci.yml`'s `notify` job (`if: always()`, reads `needs.check/build.result` → built/skipped/failed) and a build-failure alert from `build.yml`'s `Report failure to Telegram` step (`if: failure() && !inputs.from_ci`, so CI-triggered failures are reported once by `ci.yml`, not duplicated). Failure messages are minimal — a line plus the Actions run URL.

## Signing keys

`ks.keystore` (patched APKs) and `ks-p12.keystore` (merged stock bundles) use alias `andrewliang` / password `123456789`. These are committed intentionally — they are throwaway signing keys for self-built APKs, not secrets.

## Maintenance gotchas (learned operationally)

- **Forcing a full rebuild.** `ci.yml` only builds when an enabled app's current patch-bundle asset differs from what `patches-state.json` on the `update` branch records for it — it ignores config changes that don't touch a patch bundle (e.g. a new `version` pin, changed dlurls). *Adding* an app does trigger it (a table absent from the state always rebuilds). To force a complete rebuild of everything, delete `patches-state.json` from the `update` branch; CI then takes its "first time building!" path and `build.yml` builds the full `config.toml`. (Deleting `build.md` no longer forces a rebuild — it's release-notes only now.)

- **Pinned-version apps drift against newer patches.** A literal `version =` passes `-f` to the CLI, which bypasses the *version-compatibility gate* but NOT per-patch fingerprint matching. A newer patch whose fingerprint isn't in the pinned APK hard-fails the whole build (`PatchException: Failed to match the fingerprint`). Fix by excluding that patch via `excluded-patches` or setting `patcher-args = "--continue-on-error"`. (Twitter *used* to pin `11.81.0` and exclude `'Block redirecting to X Lite'` for exactly this reason — newer X builds need the **x-shim** bundle alongside Piko. That's now handled by `extra-patches-source` instead of a pin: `["Twitter/X-Piko+XShim"]` sets `version = "auto"` and combines `extra-patches-source = "gitlab:inotia00/x-shim"` with Piko in one patch run — see the `extra-patches-source` note below — which let the old pin and the X-Lite exclusion be dropped. Instagram and Facebook likewise moved from a pin to `version = "auto"` — for Facebook, `auto` resolves to De-Vanced's only supported build (currently `490.0.0.63.82`), still served from the self-hosted archive.org mirror.)

- **Apps apkmirror/uptodown won't serve (e.g. Instagram).** apkmirror increasingly 403s even from CI runners. Self-host the APK on an archive.org item and use the `archive` backend: files named `<pkg>-<version>-<arch>.apk[m]` inside a folder whose path *ends in the package name*, with `archive-dlurl` pointing at that folder. `.apkm` bundles are merged automatically. archive.org "folders" are just slashes in filenames — set them with `ia upload --remote-name=` / `ia move`, not the web uploader.

- **Signature verification is opt-in.** `check_sig` only verifies an APK if its package is listed in `sig.txt` (`<sha256> <pkg>` per line); unlisted packages are silently accepted. When adding an app, extract its official cert with `apksigner verify --print-certs` and take the value `check_sig` uses (lines starting `Signer`, containing `SHA-256`, `tail -1`), then add it. For multi-signer apps (key rotation, e.g. Instagram) that's the last signer's hash; for bundles, every split must verify to it.

- **Local testing on macOS.** The `bin/*-arm64` / `*-arm` helper binaries are Android/Bionic builds and won't run on macOS or Linux; the `-x86_64` ones are glibc Linux. To run a build locally, use a `linux/amd64` Docker container (`ubuntu`, `apt install jq openjdk-17-jre-headless zip unzip curl`, repo mounted at `/repo`) so `set_prebuilts` selects the working x86_64 binaries.

- **`clone = true` (fork-specific addition).** Non-upstream config option in `build_rv`. For a `build-mode = "both"` app it generalizes the microG hook: in **apk** mode it enables the rename patch (`Clone` if present, else `Change package name`) with `-O packageName=app.<brand>.<pkg-without-com>`, producing a coexisting clone APK; in **module** mode it omits it, keeping the original package for mounting. So one entry yields both a clone APK and an original-package module (Reddit/Instagram/Facebook). The brand = `rv-brand` lowercased, non-alphanumerics stripped (De-Vanced→devanced).

- **`extra-patches-source` (fork-specific addition).** Optional per-app key for applying a *second* patch bundle in the same patch run (e.g. `gitlab:inotia00/x-shim` together with `crimera/piko` for Twitter/X — Piko's "X-Shim + Piko" flow). `build.sh` fetches it by reusing `get_prebuilts` (so `gitlab:`/GitHub + integrations-check stripping all work; the CLI is already cached from the primary fetch) into `app_args[ptjar_extra]`; `patch_apk` appends one extra `-p` per bundle (space-separated → N-capable). Version/`auto` resolution and the module name/changelog stay on the **primary** bundle; the extra bundle's patches are default-enabled and apply without enumeration. Crucially, `build_rv` records the extra bundle's built asset into `patches-state.json` under its own source key (`log_built_patches` is called once for the primary and once for the extra), and `config_update` compares `extra-patches-source` independently (via `_patches_src_changed`, run for both primary and extra), so a new release of the extra bundle **self-triggers a daily rebuild** — it doesn't have to wait for a primary-bundle bump. `extra-patches-version` defaults to `latest`.

- **Twitter/X can't be cloned — don't add `clone = true` to it.** Verified against the configured bundles: Piko (`crimera/piko`) *does* ship a `Clone` patch, but its `compatiblePackages` is **`com.instagram.android` only** (which is why `Instagram-Piko` clones to `app.piko.instagram.android` but X never could), and x-shim (`inotia00/x-shim`) is a pure compatibility shim with no rename patch. The clone detector enumerates only the **primary** bundle's patch list, already filtered by `--filter-package-name com.twitter.android` (built by `patches_list` and scanned by the clone grep, both in `build_rv`), so a rename patch supplied via `extra-patches-source` would not be picked up even if one existed. (Piko's README also warns against layering Morphe's universal `Change package name` patch on top of Piko.) So Twitter/X stays `build-mode = "apk"`, un-cloned, sharing `com.twitter.android` with the Play Store build.

- **Telegram can't be cloned — don't add `clone = true` to it.** The Paresh bundle (`gitlab:Paresh-Maheshwari/paresh-patches`) ships *no* `Clone`/`Change package name` patch, so `clone = true` would just log `...no 'Clone'/'Change package name' patch found...; skipping clone` and rename nothing. The universal rename patch lives in the **Morphe/De-Vanced** bundles (hence clone works for Reddit-Morphe, Threads, Photos). `patch_apk` *now* supports a second bundle via `extra-patches-source` (an extra `-p`), so the rename patch could in principle be supplied alongside Paresh's — but it's unnecessary: the patched standalone build `org.telegram.messenger.web` already coexists with the Play Store build `org.telegram.messenger`. (Aside: the `clone_pkg` formula in `build_rv` strips only a `com.` prefix — `${pkg_name#com.}` — so any future non-`com.` clone target would need `${pkg_name#*.}` to generalize the TLD strip.)
